This repository is based on the work of the excellent [HomeAssistantRepository](https://git.edevau.net/onkelbeh/HomeAssistantRepository) by onkelbeh.

## Goal

The primary goal of this overlay is to provide **bleeding-edge versions** of Home Assistant, with a strong focus on the `app-misc/homeassistant-full` package. This includes untested ebuilds that usually pull directly from the latest development branch or pre-release/beta versions of Home Assistant core and its dependencies, giving users access to the newest features and fixes as soon as they land upstream.

## Important Notes

- This work **heavily relies on packages and ebuilds from the original HomeAssistantRepository**. Most ebuilds are derived, synced, or directly based on the upstream work, with modifications to enable bleeding-edge versioning.
- **Bleeding-edge means unstable**. These versions may introduce bugs, breaking changes, incomplete features, or dependency conflicts.
- **Testing is encouraged, but use in production is not advised**. Always create full backups of your Home Assistant configuration and database before installing or updating packages from this overlay.

## Maintenance

I am happy to work on additional ebuilds and USE flags to support more components **as time permits**. Contributions, bug reports, suggestions, and pull requests are very welcome!

## Current USE Flags (homeassistant-full)

The `homeassistant-full` ebuild includes an extensive set of USE flags for optional integrations. The list below represents the flags that are currently available and **more or less tested** in my own setup:

aemet androidtv androidtv_remote apple_tv backup bluetooth bthome caldav camera cast co2signal deluge dht ecowitt esphome ffmpeg forecast_solar fully_kiosk google google_assistant_sdk google_cloud google_generative_ai_conversation google_photos google_translate google_weather growatt_server home_connect html5 http ibeacon influxdb inkbird iperf3 ipma ipp isal lg_soundbar lg_thinq luci mariadb marytts matter meteoalarm meteoclimatic mobile_app mosquitto mqtt mysql network notify_events ollama onvif open_meteo openai_conversation openexchangerates openweathermap otp ping plex proxy pushover pvoutput python_script recorder rest rtsp_to_webrtc samsungtv scrape sharkiq shelly smartthings speedtestdotnet spotify sql stream systemd tasmota tesla_fleet teslemetry todoist tomorrowio tts tuya ubus upnp usb utility_meter version victron_ble weatherkit xiaomi_aqara xiaomi_ble xiaomi_miio zeroconf

> **Note**: This is only a partial preview of the full list. The complete list can be viewed with `eix app-misc/homeassistant-full` after syncing the overlay. Not every flag is exhaustively tested — some are still to be fully implemented. Feedback and requests are appreciated!

## Installation

Add the overlay to your system:

1. Create the repos.conf entry:

```ini
# /etc/portage/repos.conf/ha-bleeding-edge.conf
[ha-bleeding-edge]
location = /var/db/repos/ha-bleeding-edge
sync-type = git
sync-uri = https://github.com/tabascoz/ha-bleeding-edge.git
auto-sync = yes
priority = 50
```

2. Sync the overlay:

```
emerge --sync
```

3. Install or upgrade Home Assistant:

```
emerge -av app-misc/homeassistant-full
```

Stay on the cutting edge — but test thoroughly! This overlay is inspired by and heavily based on the outstanding work in [onkelbeh/HomeAssistantRepository](https://github.com/onkelbeh/HomeAssistantRepository). Full credit to the original maintainers and all contributors.
